Wow, okay, just... what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩??? Kimge kereksin is such a trip, like a kaleidoscope of emotions and colors somehow squeezed through a spicy meat grinder. My ears are still ringing from the theater buzz, like a swarm of electronic bees or maybe just the buzz of the popcorn machine (thank you for the remnants on my lap 😅).

Was too close to the screen, man, my neck's doing the flamingo thing while I process how that one scene where they were... flying? Or maybe running? Can't tell but it felt like I was in a dream. Like those dreams where you’re being chased by your own voice — not sure if it’s comforting or unsettling. The dialogue hit me like snippets of my own thoughts after a terrible nap.

The scent of buttery popcorn clung to the edges of my coat — or was it the  ’s aftertaste? Made me hungry and queasy at the same time. Felt like when you realize you’ve been eating week-old leftovers, and yet keep munching. It was just too magnetic to look away, like trashy reality TV but with more poetic chaos. 

> Oh, and someone leaned over said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but honestly why? You need this theater madness; it's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a tornado from inside your own fridge. Helps if you got ongoing back pain, maybe it makes the mind wander deeper? Munching. Who cares.

Was it just me or did the music taste purple today? I could taste the violins, maybe someone poured lemonade into my ears or left milk out in the rain. Yes, Milky Rain. And then the main character, their eyes were that of tired moons. You know, like how cats squeeze into boxes — their role was cut to fit, glorious and awkward hind paws sticking out with charm.

Cannot forget to tell the feelings— hard to know if they were trying to hug me or slap me silly. My friend’s probably gonna ask me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together next time, but how to explain this beautifully cluttered mess?

Here's something weird to digest: it felt like opening a drawer to find all your socks have become light bulbs. Which is basically saying, it makes no sense but it’ll definitely light up your night.
